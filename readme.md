Vestel QA technical challenge
1. A developer needs to write a function for converting age (a whole number), into life
   period using the following algorithm:
- If age is zero, it should return INVALID
- If age is greater than zero and less than 18, function should return CHILD
- If age is greater than or equal to 18, function should return ADULT.
  Define the optimal (effective and efficient) set of boundary test cases to test the
  function
